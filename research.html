    <meta name="Description" content="Joan Llull is Researcher at MOVE, Associate Professor of Economics (with tenure) at Universitat Aut&ograve;noma de Barcelona, 
                                      Affiliated Professor at Barcelona GSE, and External Fellow at CReAM (UCL). He has recently been awarded a European Research Council (ERC) 
                                      Starting Grant for his project &quot;Dynamic Modeling of Labor Market Mobility and Human Capital Accumulation (DYMOLAMO)&quot;. His research focuses
                                      on labor economics, and more specifically on immigration, internal migration, occupational mobility, inequality, human capital, family economics, 
                                      and health. His main research typically estimates dynamic discrete choice models of equilibrium, but several of his papers also use more reduced 
                                      form approaches. His work has been published in the Review of Economic Studies, Journal of Human Resources, and the European Economic Review, 
                                      among others. Professor Llull teaches several microeconometrics courses at UAB, at the different master programs of the Barcelona GSE, and

				<p>
					Recent  analysing wage effects of immigration assumes labour supply is fixed across education-experience cells. 
					This article departs from this assumption estimating a labour market equilibrium dynamic discrete choice model on U.S. 
					micro-data for 1967&ndash;2007. Individuals adjust to immigration by changing education, participation, and/or occupation. 
					Adjustments are heterogeneous: 4.2&ndash;26.2&#37; of prime-aged native males change their careers; of them, some switch to 
					white-collar careers and increase education by about three years; others reduce labour market attachment and reduce education 
					also by about three years. These adjustments mitigate initial effects on wages and inequality. Natives that are more similar 
					to immigrants are the most affected on impact, but also have a larger margin to adjust and differentiate. Adjustments also 
					produce a self-selection bias in the estimation of wage effects at the lower tail of the distribution, which the model corrects.

					I estimate the effect of immigration on wages of native male workers correcting for endogenous allocation of immigrants 
					across education-experience cells. Exogenous variation is obtained from interactions of push factors, distance, and 
					skill-cell dummies: distance mitigates the effect of push factors more severely for some skill groups. I propose a 
					two-stage approach (Sub-Sample 2SLS) that estimates the first stage regression with an augmented sample of destination 
					countries, and the second stage with a restricted sub-sample of interest. Asymptotic properties are discussed. Results 
					show important OLS biases. For U.S. and Canada, Sub-Sample 2SLS elasticities average around minus one, very stable across 
					alternative specifications and different instruments.

			<div class="content">
				<p>
					Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we analyze the 
					health gap between married and unmarried individuals of working-age. Controlling for observables, we find a gap that peaks 
					at 10 percentage points at ages 55-59. If we allow for unobserved heterogeneity in innate health (permanent and age-dependent), 
					potentially correlated with timing and likelihood of marriage, we find that the effect of marriage on health disappears below 
					age 40, while about 5 percentage points difference between married and unmarried individuals remains at older (55&ndash;59) ages. 
					This indicates that the observed gap is mainly driven by selection into marriage at younger ages, but there might be a protective 
					effect of marriage at older ages. Exploring the mechanisms behind this result, we find that better innate health is associated 
					with a higher probability of marriage and a lower probability of divorce, and there is strong assortative mating among couples 
					by innate health. We also find that married individuals are more likely to have a healthier behavior compared to unmarried ones. 
					Finally, we find that health insurance is critical for the beneficial effect of marriage.

				<p>
					In this paper I present a new database of bilateral migrant stocks and I provide new evidence on the determinants of 
					international migration. The new Census-based data are obtained from National Statistical Offices of 24 OECD countries, 
					and they cover the total stock of immigrants in each destination country for 1960–2000, including 188 countries of origin, 
					sometimes in grouped categories. For each census, I keep grouped categories in a raw manner, without making imputations 
					to specific origin countries. In the empirical analysis, I give an explicit treatment to these grouped categories. 
					Results present strong evidence of heterogeneous effects of income gains on migration prospects depending on distance. 
					For example, a 1000$ increase in US income per capita increases the stock of Mexican immigrants in the country by a 
					percentage 2.6 times larger than the percentage increase in the stock of Chinese (8 vs. 3.1&#37;).

				<p>
					This paper presents a cross-country analysis of the impact of immigration on productivity and employment. Push-distance interactions provide relevant and exogenous variation for identification. Results suggest that a one percentage point increase in the share of immigrants in the population reduces GDP per capita by 2&#37;, the employment rate by 0.89 percentage points, and average hours worked conditional on working by 1.28&#37;, whereas it increases the unemployment rate by 0.55 percentage points. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on a simple production framework provide a structural interpretation. Estimates imply a semi-elasticity of native wages to immigration of -0.7 if the extensive margin of labour supply is ignored (the zeroes of displaced workers are averaged in), and &#43;0.12 on the wages of those who remain working. The effect on immigrant wages is unambiguously negative.

					The wage gap between newly arriving immigrants and comparable natives in the US has widened substantially over the last few decades while the subsequent speed of convergence has declined. These patterns have led to a pessimistic view regarding wage assimilation prospects of immigrants. This paper unravels an unexplored mechanism that can explain an important part of these regularities: labor market competition. Because natives and immigrants are imperfect substitutes in production, increasing immigrant inflows exert stronger labor market competition on previous cohorts of immigrants than on natives, contributing to a widening wage gap. We quantify the importance of this mechanism by using a simple model that accounts for the main features of the literatures on the wage impact of immigration and wage assimilation. Our results suggest that, if competition and composition effects are netted out, immigrant cohorts are more positively selected in recent decades, and that these differences are wiped out after 10 years, implying a lower relative wage growth for recent cohorts.

				<p>
					While immigration of unskilled workers often generates controversy in the political arena, there is often more consensus 
					in favor of selective immigration policies. This paper studies the effects of selective immigration policies on the labor 
					market. High skilled immigration introduces two potentially confronting forces on labor market prospects of native workers: 
					first, it increases the competition for skilled jobs, reducing labor market opportunities, and, as a result, reducing native 
					incentives to invest in human capital; second, it increases productivity through spillovers and technological progress. I 
					pose and estimate a labor market equilibrium dynamic discrete choice model that can account for these effects. The estimated 
					model is used to evaluate the labor market consequences of the two most important skill-biased immigration policies in recent 
					U.S. history: the introduction of H-1B visa program in 1990, and the elimination of the National Origins Formula in 1965. 
					Finally, I use the model to predict the level of selectivity of immigration policy that maximizes native workers' wellbeing.

				<p>
					This paper uses a large panel assembled from Spanish administrative data for over one million individuals assembled from tax, 
					welfare and employment records over a period spanning 30 years to estimate a dynamic model of individual optimization that 
					explains transitions and spell lengths between permanent positions, temporary positions, unemployment and exits from the 
					workforce. We seek to explain the sequence of job spells in temporary contracts and unemployment transitions as new entrants 
					in the workforce gradually acquire experience and, ultimately, transition into permanent contracts. The career mobility of 
					young workers is jointly determined with geographical and occupational mobility. Thus we investigate how different types of 
					labor market experience and welfare entitlements affect job search behavior, employment duration, and migration patterns over 
					the life cycle.

					Understanding what affects consumption satisfaction is fundamental to understanding consumer behavior. Measuring satisfaction, however, is not trivial, especially in the context of experience goods where perceived quality is often subjective and unobservable prior to consumption. We report the results of a field study (N=433) conducted in collaboration with a theater that uses pay-what-you-want pricing, inviting the audience to pay at the end of the show. We find that survey measures of post-consumption enjoyment capture only part of consumer satisfaction. This occurs because individuals with a larger positive gap between self-reported expected and actual enjoyment pay significantly more. Our analyses further indicate that neither expected nor realized enjoyment predict payments once we control for the expectation-realization gap. The paper highlights the managerial implications of these findings.

					Traditional models of brain drain stress its negative impact on the welfare and growth of sending economies, while new 
					models introduce the possibility of brain gain through several channels (human capital, remittances, return migration 
					or FDI and trade linkages). We test all these theories by estimating cross-country individual regressions for each channel, 
					and a system of equations to assess the overall effect of brain drain on economic growth. Results suggest a negative effect 
					on human capital stock, negligible on remittances (controlling for total migration) and a positive effect on trade and FDI. 
					The net impact of skilled migration on economic growth remains ambiguous.
